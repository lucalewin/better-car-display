# AASDK: Proof of concept

This example project demonstrates that the aasdk can be used as a middleware between android's `desktop-head-unit` and the android auto app.

## Requirements

- cargo
- adb
- desktop-head-unit
- android phone

## How to use

- Connect your phone with your computer (via USB cable)
- Start the head unit server in the android auto app
- run `run.bat` in your terminal
- in a second terminal start the head unit server

If everything goes well, you should be able to see `successfully authenticated` in your first terminal
